Relationship-Centric IoT

Existing programming issues in smart settings such as smart homes, smart buildings, and smart cities are exacerbated by the increasing complexity and prevalence of IoT devices. Recent works have focused on detecting conflicts for the safety and utility of IoT applications, but they often do not highlight the representation of devices and policies included in the smart settings. Thus, we propose Relationship-Centric IoT, a command-respond framework for resolving Internet-of-Things conflicts which also shows great performance in representing device and policy information based on former works like Web of Things (WoT) and Brick. User can input a command or rule as an input, and a respond will be output by the framework after conflict resolution. Another contribution of this project is that our data comes from real-world application. For example, the device information implemented in this paper comes from Computer Science and Engineering Building (EBU3B) in University of California San Diego (UCSD) built in 2004 with 15000 square feet, 4,594 points and 8,383 relationships \cite{balaji2018brick}. The policies implemented in this paper comes from Samsung SmartThings applications and IFTTT applets
