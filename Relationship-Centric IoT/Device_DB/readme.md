You can use [**brick_convert.ipynb**](https://github.com/Halleloya/LinkingIoT/blob/main/Relationship-Centric%20IoT/Device_DB/brick_convert.ipynb) for achieving Brick - WoT Thing description process. Also, you can download the results of converting Computer Science and Engineering Building (EBU3B) in University of California San Diego (UCSD) built in 2004 with 15000 square feet, 4,594 points and 8,383 relationships in [**Google Drive**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kx9Qvws2LxiycLLepxoUXiyVJ_7BYvyY/view?usp=sharing). 

If you just want to convert smaller dataset for practice, you can input [**bldg.ttl**](https://github.com/Halleloya/LinkingIoT/blob/main/Relationship-Centric%20IoT/Device_DB/bldg.ttl) to [**brick_convert.ipynb**](https://github.com/Halleloya/LinkingIoT/blob/main/Relationship-Centric%20IoT/Device_DB/brick_convert.ipynb), you can find the results for above conversion in [**Examples**](https://github.com/Halleloya/LinkingIoT/tree/main/Relationship-Centric%20IoT/Device_DB/Example_conversion)
